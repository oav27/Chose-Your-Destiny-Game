# Python Freshman Adventure Game

Project created in Python for a freshman high school AP CSP course. A simple "You-Choose" adventure game!

---

### **Warning! This game was created my freshman year in HIGH SCHOOL! I chose to keep it as I created it over 5+ years ago, to show the progress I have made in my coding skills and knowledge since then. I also left the orignial "Written Response" file that I wrote for submission to my AP course in this repo. Take a look to see some of my findings and breakdowns in addition to the writings below. Thank you and have fun!**

### The Brainstorming:

When trying to determine what kind of game I wanted to make, I knew I wanted it to be simple and fun. This was when I thought of these books that my father passed down to me from his own childhood. Growing up as a teen in the 80's, my father had an afinity for the *Choose Your Own Adventure* book series. So, when I became of age, he passed down all of his books, including the *You Are A Millionaire* book shown below. This book specifically, and my father, was the inspiration behind this game.

### Pre Coding/Planning Stage:

Now with the idea in tow, I went to the planning stage. I first wanted to decide where the game will take place. Then, based on the setting, I started coming up with all the possible paths the player could go on. I also thought it could be fun if you find a backpack or supplies in general, drawing from the book in which the main character finds a bag of a million dollars. These supplies would then serve to either help win or loose the game.

In order to envision this and stay organized, I literally drew out all the paths on a piece of paper. I'd keep track of which path would garner points, or lose lives. How the supplies would come in handy on certain paths, and so on. Once the drawing was complete, my paper ended up looking like a huge tree. Each branch representing a path that could be taken by the player (very fortelling of my future encounters with recursion). Of course, now that I had the paths figured out, I decided that I wanted to use functions to create the paths. After that, I created how I would have the title screen look. Now to coding!

### Actual Coding:

During the actual coding process, it was very straight forward. I was happy that while creating this project I was able to use what I learned of Python, and code in general (if statements, conditionals, variables, functions, etc.) since 

### this was my first coding language and project ever!!

Of course I encountered some difficulties, which I will talk about later. I also was learning the magic and power of testing and debugging one's code. I remember that after every function, or path, that I would code, I would stop to test the code. I made sure I didn't make any syntactical errors, or that I had strewn the functions together in the right order. I also would test out that the decisions made would correctly correlate with points being added, or lives being deducted, and that the game would correctly keep score of them.

### Difficulties Encountered:

Some of the difficulties that I encountered when creating this game was getting lost in all the functions. Orginization was a major lesson here. Although I had it all drawn out on a piece of paper, it was not the same when actually putting it into code. Now, as a CS major in college, I look back on this project and see how I could have built the files differently to stay more organized.

---

### Final Words:

Looking back on this project, and the code that I have left, I would definitely change some things. I would give better variable names, write more comments, and create more files. All of these steps I believe would be better for organization. By having more simple and short variable names, and more comments I can sift through more code more easily, knowing which path is where in relation to the entire game. Putting more comments is something that I most definitely picked up as I coded more and created more coding projects in other languages (hint hint, look at my other repos). Having more files I believe will help with organizing the different paths/functions. I could have them split up into three acts of paths. Once done with the first act, go to second act, and then the third of functions. These are just some spit ball of ideas, but my first thoughts upon observation of this very old code of mine.

However, in the end I loved creating this project. It brought back great memories of reading this book with my dad, and then taking the book with me on road trips to see what other paths I could take. It helped me cement what I had learned in my AP CSP class and the syntax of Python. Since Python and this project was one the first tastes I had of coding, I am forever fond and proud of this game I created.

### Example Run of Game, Enjoy!
