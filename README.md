# Freshman-Game-in-Python
Project Created in Python for a freshman high school CS course. A simple "You-Choose" adventure game!

**Warning! This game was created my freshman year in HIGH SCHOOL! I chose to keep it as I created it over 5+ years ago, to show the progress I have made in my coding skills and knowledge since then. Have fun!**
